# Advanced-House-Prediction-EDA

## Introduction
In this Data science project I tried to create Jupyter notebooks for EDA and feature engineering of Advanced House Price Prediction Dataset from Kaggle Competition.


## Problem statement
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this main aim of this model is to predict the final price of each home.

In other words, we are training a machine learning model to learn to learn the relatioship between the featurees of houses and their prices and subsequently predict on the data that our model has been trained on. 

## Evaluation metric
For each Id in the test set, we must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.
